\usage{
generate_acknowledgement(data, style = c("paragraph", "bullets", "numbered"))
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing at least the column Acknowledgement.}

\item{style}{Output style: "paragraph", "bullets", or "numbered".}
}
\value{
A character string with the combined acknowledgements.
}
\description{
Combines acknowledgements provided by the authors into a single,
coherent sentence. The function ignores author names (as they are assumed to be
included in the acknowledgement text itself) and simply concatenates each non-empty
acknowledgement entry using a semicolon.
}
\examples{
authors <- data.frame(
  Acknowledgement = c("This work received support from resource X", 
                      "Resource Y was instrumental", 
                      "Alice Smith received support from resource ZZ"),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
generate_acknowledgement(authors, style = "paragraph")
}
