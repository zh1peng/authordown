- URL checks failed in this environment due to lack of internet access
  (offline check). The URLs are valid and reachable online.
- Staged installation could not be used locally due to Windows file locking;
  checks were run with R_INSTALL_STAGED=false. CRAN will use staged install.
- "unable to verify current time" and "lastMiKTeXException" are local
  environment artifacts.
